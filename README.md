# Project Proposal 
## Overview
17.6 Million US Citizens were subject to identity theft in 2014. Passport issuance is prone to inconsistencies and have lead to trillions of dollars being misused. Given state of digitalisation and our dependencies on fraud-prone technologies, it's more important than ever before to implement this. 

## Motive
- Blockchain offers an infrastructure of transparency, event tracking, cryptography and the chance to improve security sensor and data sharing -- which some security solutions and implementations on enterprise networks lack.

- Directly applicable to everybody - even our ex-President was accused of faking his own identity!  

## Functionality
- Two contracts are being implemented. registry.sol and exchange.sol. 
- registry.sol would hold the records. 
- exchange.sol would serve as the intermediary between the client and the embassy
- ether payment charges would incurred to put the identity on the blockchain platform.
- In order to maximise security and protection of identity: we will be using SHA-256 encryption based on user passport information such as:
-- place of birth
-- date of issuance
-- first name 
-- last name
