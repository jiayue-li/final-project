# Project Proposal 
## Overview
17.6 Million US Citizens were subject to identity theft in 2014. Birth certificate issuance is prone to inconsistencies and have lead to trillions of dollars being misused. Given state of digitalisation and our dependencies on fraud-prone technologies, it's more important than ever before to implement this. 

## Motive
- Blockchain offers an infrastructure of transparency, event tracking, cryptography and the chance to improve security sensor and data sharing -- which some security solutions and implementations on enterprise networks lack.

- Directly applicable to everybody - even our ex-President was accused of faking his own certificate!  

## Functionality
- Two contracts are being implemented. registry.sol and exchange.sol. 
- registry.sol would hold the records. 
- exchange.sol would serve as the intermediary between the patient and the hospital
- Ethereum would be used to put the identity on the blockchain platform.
